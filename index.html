    <h1>Personas and Storyboarding: The CVS Self-Checkout System</h1>
    <p class="info">Location: inside CVS (291 Thayer St.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Abstract:</b> For this project, I am stepping into a user’s shoes. I have observed real users 
      interacting with an interface, interviewed these individuals about their experiences, 
      created personas based on these users, and illustrated a storyboard for one of my
      personas. 
    </p>
      <p>
        <i>My chosen interface is the CVS self-checkout system</i>, located at the CVS on
        Thayer St. It allows customers to check out and pay for items themselves without 
        having to consult a cashier. The interface consists of a main control touch screen, 
        where scanned items appear and decisions about payment are taken, a scanning apparatus, 
        which scans the barcode on each item, and a card reader, which handles payment. 
      </p>

    <h2>
      Key Observations from Observing Users
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="list-item">
        Two of the three users were moving through each screen of the CVS self-checkout 
        interface quite quickly; they were very eager to scan their items quickly and select 
        the “continue” and “credit/debit” buttons before presenting their payment method
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Perhaps as a result of moving too quickly, one of these users forgot to press the 
        “credit/debit” button before inserting his card into the reader; he quickly realized 
        however, and pressed the button (with his card in the reader) before an error could 
        appear (as it has for me in the past) 
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        One user moved more slowly, taking more time to reach the text on each screen before 
        pressing a button on the touch screen
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        None of the three users revealed much emotion—they all remained relatively stoic 
        while using the interface 
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Two of the users were unable to scan certain items on the first try—when this 
        happened it took 2-3 tries to get the system to scan the item properly 
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Two of the taller users (above 5 foot 8 inches)  had to bend down a little bit in 
        order to see the numbers on the card reader when typing in their pin 
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        All three users selected the “No Receipt” option at the end 
      </li>
    </ul>

      Interview Questions and Answers
    </h2>
    <ol class="questions">
      <li class="list-item">
        <b>Why do you choose the self-checkout method as opposed to going to the cashier?</b> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Do the individual components of the interface— the touch screen that shows the 
          scanned items, the scanning/loading area below, and the card reader and its 
          screen—work well together? 
        </b>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <b>
          How would you describe the process of moving through the screens when checking out? 
          Does the flow and organization of the touch screen make sense?
        </b>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <b>
          What, if anything, would you change about either the interface design or the 
          way it works?
        </b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <u>Summarized Responses</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list-item">
        The reason for using the self-checkout method as opposed to the cashier was 
        generally <i>in the interest of time and simplicity</i>; each user noted that 
        unless they have cash on-hand, they usually use self-checkout 
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        One user admitted that he is a little bit antisocial and awkward and thus he 
        prefers <i>using the self-checkout to avoid any unnecessary human interaction</i>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        The users thought the individual components of the interface worked well together and 
        made sense, as <i>each component serves a specific purpose </i>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        The flow and organization of the touch screen also makes sense, although some of the 
        buttons/functions like <i>“Use My Own bag”</i> and <i>“Phone Number Lookup”</i> come 
        along with a little confusion as they are rarely, if ever, used
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        The only proposed change was by one of the taller users, who touched on the annoying 
        nature of having to bend down to type in his pin; <i>he proposed that the card reader 
          screen be placed horizontally, parallel to the floor</i>, as opposed to vertically, in 
        order to better see the numbers on the keypad
      </li>
    </ul>
